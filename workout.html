        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>I work out for my mind. When I work out and I push myself to the point where I am about to fall to the ground and fall asleep. When i'm done working out and see progress over time it makes me feel accomplished. It makes my mind satisfied and my body shows it and most defenitly feels it.</p>

        <h2>Nutrition/Diet</h2>
        <p>Eat something good for your muscles two hours before each workout and then immediately after your workout.</p>

        <h2>Stretching</h2>
        <p>Make sure you stretch your whole body before your workout.</p>

        <h2>Workout</h2>
        <p>Everyday: Handgrip (3x your choice)</p>
        <p>Monday & Wednesday (Lower Body): Squats (3x your choice), Wall Sits (3x your choice)</p>
        <p>Tuesday & Thursday (Upper Body): Push Ups, Bench Press, Overhead Press, Dumbbell Lateral Raise (Side & Front), Dumbbell Rows, Curls (each 3x your choice)</p>

        <h2>Recovery</h2>
